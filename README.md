# pstel_radiomobile
Radio mobile data analysis. Done with node

When calling coverage_read, you need to pass 2 arguments, the first one being the source radiomobile file, and the second one the result filename you want to choose.

For generating_chart you need only one argument, that is the result file generated by coverage_read. Have fun and nice studies.
